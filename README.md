# Homework Assignment #1

In order to run the homework, go to _src/q3main.py_. Then run the file. Later you are going to see the prompt 

>**Enter the name of the question you want to see the solution of(Type "exit" to exit the program):**

You are expected to write:

* question1
* question2
* question3
* question4
* question5
* question6
* exit

Depending on your answer, the corresponding question is going to work. Otherwise the program is going to ask for a proper answer once again. When the execution of the question finishes, the observer can enter another question without exiting the program.
